{"name":"Inkscape Grid Maker","tagline":"Inkscape extension to generate grids: guides defining columns and gutters.","body":"Inkscape grid maker\r\n===================\r\n\r\n> This [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) extension will generate a grid (guides) with **equal width columns and gutters**, or rows and gutters.\r\n\r\n*In graphic design, a grid is a structure (usually two-dimensional) made up of a series of intersecting straight (vertical, horizontal, and angular) or curved guide lines used to structure content. The grid serves as an armature on which a designer can organize graphic elements (images, glyphs, paragraphs) in a rational, easy to absorb manner*. - [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_%28graphic_design%29)\r\n\r\nThis extension was conceived as a tool for making grids when designing websites in Inkscape. The guides are therefore positioned using (rounded) pixels. Not tested with other units.\r\n\r\nIt is an alternative to positioning paths and converting them to guides, or to using the Grids in the Document Properties.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n![grid maker in action](https://github.com/sambody/inkscape-grid-maker/raw/master/readme-img/inkscape-gridmaker.png)\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n- Define number of columns, column width and gutter width to generate a grid;\r\n- Gutter width can be set to zero;\r\n- Choose to align the grid in relation to the page: left aligned, centered or right aligned;\r\n- On top of this alignment, you can set a left offset (for columns), or top offset (for rows) - this offset distance can be negative;\r\n- Same with rows - horizontal guides with gutters and offset;\r\n- Option to delete all existing guides before generating the new guides;\r\n- Live preview to test different widths\r\n\r\n### How to install the extension\r\n\r\n1. Download the zip archive to your computer;\r\n2. Unzip (extract) the archive on your computer;\r\n3. Open it. In the folder grid-maker-extension, you wil find two files: **grid_maker.inx** and **grid_maker.py**. Copy these two files (and only these two files) into your Inkscape extensions folder:\r\n\r\n- on Windows: \"C:\\Program Files\\Inkscape\\share\\extensions\"\r\n- on Linux: \" ~/.config/inkscape/extensions\" (where \"~\" is /home/yourusername/)\r\n- on OS X: \"/Applications/Inkscape.app/Contents/Resources/extensions\" \r\n\r\nRestart or open Inkscape.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nYou will find the extension under menu **Extensions > Render > Guides grid maker** (not to be confused with Guides creator, or Grid).\r\n\r\nChange the settings, click Apply. Close. Done.\r\n\r\nOr change the settings, select Live Preview, adjust settings, click Apply. Close. Done.\r\n\r\nThat's it.\r\n\r\n### Tips\r\n\r\n- You can generate several grids, clicking *Apply* for every grid - just be sure to *uncheck \"Delete existing guides*\". \r\n- Need guides in the middle of your gutters? After generating the columns, generate a new grid with gutters set to zero, column width set to [original column width + gutter width].\r\n- You can generate several grids side by side, using the large offset. Play with it.\r\n- No need for outer gutters/guides? Just delete them manually.\r\n- Need a *baseline grid* in addition to the generated columns ? For that it might make more sense to make a new Grid under File > Document Properties > Grids instead of this extension - setting Spacing X to 2000, Spacing Y to 14 for example. You can then toggle the guides and the baseline grid independently with shortcuts.\r\n\r\n### Other grid related tools for web design\r\n\r\nOnline grid generators and previewers that might be useful in combination with the Grid Maker extension (I sometimes use some of them to get the right widths *before* using my extension): \r\n\r\n- [grid calculator](http://www.29digital.net/grid/)\r\n- [variable grid system](http://grids.heroku.com/) - this tool can actually generate css classes, just input the same numbers you used for designing your grid (fluid and fixed css grid)\r\n- [grid calculator and generator](Grid calculator and generator) - set a fixed total width, give a range of column/gutter width, get all possible combinations.\r\n\r\nThe Grid Maker extension generates guides, helpful for example in *designing* websites. However, it does *not* create the css - you will have to do that yourself. Some ready made tools and frameworks that can help with grid based websites (in addition to learning css!): [variable grid system](http://grids.heroku.com/), [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/), [susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/)  , and [many others](css grid framework)... or build your own...\r\n\r\n### Bugs, wishlist, to do (no promises...)\r\n\r\n- when gutter set to zero, there should be single guides, not double guides;\r\n- allow the choice to include (or not) the outer gutters/guides;\r\n- Align grid in relation to a selected bounding box, instead of the whole page ?\r\n- Show total width when changing settings, if possible.\r\n- ~~Show offset option only when choosing Alignment with offset (or find better solution)~~ Offset is now available to all alignments\r\n- Option to add guide in the middle of each gutter (if gutter width is even number...) - for now, you can add center gutters separately by generating a new grid\r\n- Ability to set total width ? And set gutter width, with automatic column width (no rounded pixels...)\r\n- other units than pixels ? Milimeters ? (see other Grid Creator extension...) Should the guide be allowed to be on non-rounded positions ? (maybe for print ?)\r\n\r\n### Thank you\r\n\r\nThanks to the creator of the [Inkscape Guides Creator](http://code.google.com/p/inkscape-guides-creator/), the extension which I used as a base for this one. Most of the work was already done, I just adapted it to my needs.\r\n\r\n### Licence\r\n\r\nLicence of the Grid Maker plugin : GPL v2, just like Inkscape.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
